# 🌐 Cloud-Based Online IDE

A **Cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** designed for developers who need seamless access to a powerful, browser-based code editor, execution environment, and collaborative development tools — all in one place.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a modern, developer-centric cloud IDE that allows users to write, edit, run, and manage code directly from their browsers. Built with scalability, security, and modularity in mind, the IDE supports multiple programming languages and integrates essential developer tools like terminal access, version control, and live preview.

## ✨ Key Features

- 💻 **Multi-language Support** – Supports Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Java, and more.
- 🧱 **Modular Architecture** – Built with a microservices approach for easy scaling and maintenance.
- 🔐 **Secure Execution** – Sandboxed container-based code execution.
- 🖥️ **Live Code Editor** – Uses the Monaco Editor (same as VS Code).
- 📂 **File Management** – Built-in file system viewer for easy navigation.
- 🧪 **Integrated Terminal** – Real-time terminal emulation inside the browser.
- 📦 **Git Integration** – Supports Git-based version control within the IDE.
- 🛠️ **Customizable Themes** – Choose from a variety of syntax highlighting themes.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Features** – Syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and linting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Docker
- **Execution Environment**: Docker containers for code isolation
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user projects & metadata)
- **Authentication**: JWT & OAuth (Google/GitHub login optional)
- **Hosting/Cloud**: AWS/GCP/Render (configurable)

## 📐 System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with modular microservices:

- Frontend (React SPA)
- API Gateway (Node.js/Express)
- Execution Service (Docker container handler)
- File Storage Service
- Authentication Service

Each component communicates over REST or WebSocket protocols.

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit Testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Integration Testing (Postman + Mocha)
- Manual Testing on multiple devices and screen sizes

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Execution in isolated Docker containers
- Input sanitization and output control
- Secure JWT-based session handling
- HTTPS enforced for all communications

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

/client          # React Frontend
/server          # Node.js Backend APIs
  /docker          # Code Execution Containers
README.md

```

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reduce dependency on local environments
- Enable education and collaboration in low-resource settings
- Provide real-time feedback, terminal access, and Git integration
- Serve as a base framework for custom developer-focused platforms

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Multi-user collaboration (Google Docs-style editing)
- Real-time chat and comments on code blocks
- Persistent cloud storage (via S3 or Firebase)
- Plugin architecture for language-specific tools
- Support for mobile-friendly coding
